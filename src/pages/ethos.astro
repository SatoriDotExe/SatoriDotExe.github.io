    <p>This is a guide. </p></br>

    <p>A toolkit for wanderers.</p></br>

    <p>A field manual for your inner and outer world.</p></br>

    <p>A collection of things that work and things that last.</p>
    <p>Things that won't sell your data and won't let you down.</p></br>

    <p>The algorithm wants you passive,</p>
    <p>wants you to keep scrolling.</p></br>

    <p>We'd rather you get lost.</p>
