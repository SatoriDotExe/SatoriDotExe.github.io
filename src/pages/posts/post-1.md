  <span class="firstchar">S</span><span class="smallcaps">tuart Brand created the</span> *Whole Earth Catalog* in 1968 in an attempt to connect people to their environment. While the tagline *"access to tools"* sounds vague and somewhat quant, that was by design. While it did contain reviews of all of the typical products we would consider tools, it also served as a colleciton of a wide variety of tools: everything from geodesic dome house kits to reviews of Carl Jung books.
